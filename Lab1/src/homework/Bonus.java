/*
Implement an efficient algorithm that determines, if possible, a subset of distinct words W1,W2,...,Wk (from the ones that you have generated) such that k â‰¥ 3 and Wi and Wi+1 are neighbors, for all i in [1..k], where Wk+1=W1.
Can you find the largest possible k?
R:  The largest possible k cannot be found through an efficient algorithm because that will lead to finding a hamiltonian cycle in a graph, a problem which is proven that is NP-complete.
    A subset of words with the properties presented above reduces to the problem of finding a cycle in a graph( every word corresponds to a vertex, for example words[0] corresponds to vertex 0).
    For finding a cycle in a graph I will use a DFS traversal.
    The complexity of the algorithm is O(n+m) where n is the number of words(vertices) and m is the number of edges( given by the presence of a common letter between two words ).
